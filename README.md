This repository contains four independent Python-based tasks, each demonstrating skills in data fetching, analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning. Each task includes clear deliverables such as scripts, dashboards, reports, or notebooks.
Task 1: Weather Data Visualization
Objective
Use Python to fetch weather data from a public API (such as OpenWeatherMap) and create visualizations to present insights like temperature trends, humidity levels, and weather conditions.

Technologies Used

API Integration with Python

Data Visualization using Matplotlib or Seaborn

Deliverables

A Python script that fetches weather data

A visualization dashboard displaying key metrics

Task 2: File-Based Data Analysis and PDF Reporting
Objective
Develop a script that reads data from a file (e.g., CSV), performs basic data analysis, and generates a formatted PDF report summarizing the results.

Technologies Used

Data Analysis with Pandas

PDF Generation using FPDF or ReportLab

Deliverables

A Python script that processes and analyzes the data

A sample PDF report with the findings

Task 3: NLP-Based Chatbot
Objective
Build a chatbot that can understand and respond to user queries using natural language processing techniques.

Technologies Used

Natural Language Processing using NLTK or spaCy

Python scripting for chatbot logic

Deliverables

A Python script implementing the chatbot

A working chatbot capable of handling basic user queries

Task 4: Predictive Modeling with Scikit-learn
Objective
Create a predictive model using Scikit-learn to classify or predict outcomes from a dataset, such as detecting spam emails.

Technologies Used

Machine Learning with Scikit-learn

Data Preprocessing and Evaluation

Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step implementation

Deliverables

A Jupyter Notebook showcasing the modelâ€™s development, training, and evaluation
